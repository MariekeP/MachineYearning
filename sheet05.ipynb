    "## Assignment 3: Eigenfaces [5 Points]\n",
    "\n",
    "A very famous example of applying PCA to solve classification problems are Eigenfaces. It employs PCA to project training images of faces into the Eigenspace to reduce the dimensionality of those images by a few magnitudes. To classify test images they are projected into the Eigenspace and the (euclidean) distance between the sample and each reduced training image is calculated - the closest training image wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid problems with your own implementation of PCA in assignment 2 you will now rely on the `scipy` package which already provides an implementation of PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will implement the Eigenfaces algorithm and apply it to a subset of the [Extended Yale Face Database B](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/FaceData.html) (the subset of files is stored in `eigenfaces.zip`). Then you will apply the same procedure to another data set, [leafsnap](http://leafsnap.com/dataset/) (`leafsnap.zip`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The face dataset is provided in two sets (`eigenfaces/train` and `eigenfaces/test`) which each yield four images per each of five different people in the [pgm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) format (which is supported by `matplotlib` via `pillow`). \n",
    "The leafsnap dataset is provided in two sets as well (`leafsnap/train` and `leafsnap/test`) which each contain two images of leaves from 184 different tree species. They were automatically cropped to square images, resized to a resolution of 200x200 pixels and converted to the [png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) format.\n"

    "To apply PCA on the samples you first need to understand what we are trying to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a grayscale image is seen as a set of pixels each being a three dimensional datapoint consisting of features X coordinate, Y coordinate and gray value. This is very useful for many types of segmentation or clustering problems, where our image is a space with three dimensions (X, Y, Color).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Eigenface method we have to consider images in a different way!\n",
    "Here each image is one data point in the hyper space containing all possible images with the same resolution. So each image is a data point consisting of pixel many dimensions or features, each having a value of the color at that pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a little bit more clear, consider the 2x2 binary images (see the plot below). Each image is one out of 16 possible data points in the space of all possible 2x2 binary images. The space has four dimensions with two possible values in each, so there are $2^4=16$ possible images. They can be described as feature vectors: \n",
