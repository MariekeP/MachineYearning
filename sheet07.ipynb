This allows us to avoid redundant calculations. The sigmoid function is a special case of the more general *Logistic function* which can be found in many different fields: Biology, chemistry, economics, demography and recently most prominently: artificial neural networks."

    "Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can be regarded as a simple concatenation (and parallelization) of several perceptrons, each having a specified activation function $\\sigma$ and a set of weights $\\mathbf{w}_{ij}$. The idea that this can be done was discovered early after the invention of the perceptron, but people didn't really use it in practice because nobody really knew how to figure out the appropriate $\\mathbf{w}_{ij}$. The solution to this problem was the discovery of the backpropagation algorithm which consists of two steps: first propagating the input forward through the layers of the MLP and storing the intermediate results and then propagating the error backwards and adjusting the weights of the units accordingly.\n",
